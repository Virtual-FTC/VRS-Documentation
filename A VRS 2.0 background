4 big projects ideas to get to runnng a program like ROADRuner in the VRS
  Embed a java compiler and runner into the browser.
    We want to be able to write multiple java files, compile them, and run them all in the browser locally.
    This requires bundling the javac compiler (graalvm)
    This requires a runtime in the browser (cheerpj)
  Write VRS replacements for the FTC SDK
    We want to be able to run code using our implementations of features like DcMotor, IMU, HardwareMap, etc.
    We need a lifecycle manager that can selectively initialize, run, and stop opmodes.
    These need to be written in Java.
    Consideration for communicating with JavaScript and the Unity WebGL is needed.
Build a java IDE for the web
    We want to support directories and multiple java files in our java editor.
    This involves a file tree selector, editor tabs.
    Intellisense and auto-import would be nice but are not a priority.
    We are also looking at rewriting the entire UI in React and have drawn out a prototype on paper.
Android Studio Plugin with Local VRS( see What about using this Android app approach? : Android App to allow VRS users to use multi-class programs with dependencies (roadrunner, FTClib, etc)
  https://github.com/Virtual-FTC/VRS-Android-App older )
    We want to add a button to Android Studio that can deploy robot code to the VRS local app.
    Ideally doesnâ€™t modify the coding experience.
    A pipeline that looks promising is: bundling the APK, converting it to JAR, hot swapping our java implementations, adding an entry point, and executing it using the local java runtime.
    We hope that this supports external libraries, requires investigation for .so files.
